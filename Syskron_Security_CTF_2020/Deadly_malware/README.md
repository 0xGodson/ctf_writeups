3. Triton, a malware with environmental consequences

First detected in 2017, when it was targeting the Saudi Arabian petrol company Petro Rabigh, this malware could have caused enormous harm, including marine pollution, a spike in petrol prices, and even deaths due to explosion. Its MO? Reprogramming the controllers of the Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS).

According to the latest reports on this cyberattack, Triton went unnoticed for three years before being detected. An unsettling piece of news, now that the malware seems to have resurfaced in April 2019.
